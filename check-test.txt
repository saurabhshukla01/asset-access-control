You can **test with `curl` directly from your command prompt (CMD)** by following these steps. Below are full working examples for each user type.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 1: Open your Command Prompt (CMD)

- Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 2: Run Django server

Make sure your Django server is already running in another terminal:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

### ‚úÖ STEP 3: Use these `curl` commands in CMD

#### üëâ Admin Test (username: `admin`, password: `admin`)

```cmd
curl -u admin:admin http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/assets/
```

> ‚úÖ This will show all assets including `name` and `secret_key`.

---

#### üëâ Member Test (username: `member`, password: `member`)

```cmd
curl -u member:member http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/assets/
```

> ‚úÖ This will show only asset `name` values (no `secret_key`).

---

#### ‚ùå Unauthenticated Test (no login)

```cmd
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/assets/
```

> ‚ùå This should return something like:

```json
{"detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."}
```

---

### ‚úÖ TIP: Pretty-print the JSON output (optional)

If you have Python installed, you can pipe the result into Python for nice formatting:

```cmd
curl -u admin:admin http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/assets/ | python -m json.tool
```

Let me know if you want to save this as a `.bat` file for quick reuse or test it with `httpie` for prettier output.
